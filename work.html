      <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          In 2025, I entered a new learning phase centered on full-stack development and large language models (LLMs). I'm currently developing a personal end-to-end project that integrates an LLM with a custom frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and a Node.js backend. This hands-on initiative is designed to deepen my expertise in modern application architecture, AI integration, and real-world LLM deployment workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
          This builds upon a solid foundation developed in 2024, when I made a clear decision to strengthen my data science skills through hands-on experience. I participated in real-world challenges competitions, often in collaboration with a brilliant and supportive colleague.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a selection of representative projects from this period:
        </p>
