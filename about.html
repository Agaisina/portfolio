      <h2>Personal Story</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an enthusiastic, purpose-driven professional who thrives at the intersection of technology and human development. My journey has taken me across different industries and contexts — each one expanding my perspective and deepening my belief that knowledge is not just power, but service.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Machine Learning Lead, I’ve designed and implemented data solutions that solve complex, real-world problems. But over time, I discovered that my most impactful work doesn’t come from logic alone — it comes from balancing clarity and structure with emotional intelligence, creativity, and authentic collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m deeply curious by nature. I love learning about new fields, understanding how things connect, and translating abstract ideas into actionable, grounded plans. Whether I’m organizing a project roadmap or mentoring a team, I bring strong organizational skills, a sense of purpose, and the drive to do things well — always aligning with my core values: creativity, authenticity, knowledge, and truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, my focus is on building data-driven products that empower people and organizations, while creating environments where both systems and people can thrive. I believe that success isn’t just about what we build — it’s about how aligned we are while building it.
